# [React Portfolio](http://butsnieva.github.io/portfolio-v2)

## Description
My personal website is a digital portfolio of the work I have accomplished since pursuing a career in web development. This website uses React as a framework to develop a highly-performant, single-page web application.

Through this website users can learn a little bit about me, view my recent works, contact me through an email form, and view my resume and technological proficiencies.

Thanks for checking it out!
